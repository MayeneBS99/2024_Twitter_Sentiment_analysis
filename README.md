This project involves the analysis of tweets from France, the UK, and the USA in 2024. The analysis is divided into three parts.
The first part focuses on translating the tweets into a single language, the second identifies topics for each tweet, and the third analyzes the sentiment of the tweets.
We use OpenAI models to perform all these tasks.
